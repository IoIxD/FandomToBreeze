Quick and dirty browser extension that redirects fandom.com URLs to breezewiki.com. Not associated with the BreezeWiki team.

Not on the store yet because BreezeWiki isn't technically finished (although its good enough). [See instructions on how to install this here](https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/how-to-install-a-chrome-extension-from-github/)
